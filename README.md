## --> --> PROJECT MODULE 1 
-CREATE A CLEAN DATA TABLE COMBINING DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES __

As part of my Ironhack experience, I am confronted to the challenge to combined all what I have been learning over the last 3 months into one ONLY CHALLENGE: CREATE A CLEAN DATA TABLE USING DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES... IT HAS BEEN HARD!
                     
                     
## **THE TABLE**

I am creating a table with 5 columns:
- 1ºst column: Country
- 2ºnd column: Job Title
- 3ºnd column: Job Title
- 4ºnd column: Job Title
- 5ºnd column: Job Title   
                     

## **THE DATA SOURCES**     
                     
3 data sources: .db file, data from the Open Skills Project API and Eurostat [web scrapping necessary]                 

## **THE RESULT**            

                     A .csv file with more than 30 000 lines of information!!
